# Monadic Parser Combinator written in swift
A simple haskell-style monadic combinator-based parser written in Swift.

A minium interpreter is also implemented in this tiny project.

## Features:

- Pure parser process without any side effects.
- Implemented with Haskell-like monad based operator `return`,`>>=`, and `zero`.
- Easy to scale up to deal with complex language parse and interprete.
- Concise code which extremely easy to understand and modify.


> Currently performance is pool, just in order to keep structure simple, there are lots of unoptimized string and array operation in the code.
